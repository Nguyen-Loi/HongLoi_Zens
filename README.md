Hello, my name is Loi and I'm interested in joining the Flutter team at ZENS as an intern. I have a passion for mobile app development and I believe that Flutter is an excellent platform for creating beautiful, performant, and scalable apps. I have some experience working with Flutter and I'm eager to learn more about the framework and the mobile app development process.

As an intern, I'm excited about the opportunity to work alongside a team of talented developers at ZENS and to gain hands-on experience building mobile apps. I'm a quick learner, a great communicator, and I thrive in collaborative environments. I'm confident that my enthusiasm, work ethic, and willingness to learn make me a great fit for the intern position on the Flutter team at ZENS.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the company's mission and to learn and grow as a developer.
