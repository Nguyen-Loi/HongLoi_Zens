## Getting Started

- Running the App
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the root directory of the app.
3. Run the following command to install dependencies: pub get
4. Run the following command to start: flutter run


 
## Result 
* Notes:
+ I am using Firebase for my database and I find the cookie mechanism in Flutter to be not very prominent. As a result, I have resorted to using a device ID instead. However, it is important to note that using a device ID may have potential drawbacks, such as if a user switches devices or clears their device data, their ID may change, which could result in lost data or errors in the app.
+ If you still want me to use cookies I can still follow your request. Thank
